## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to design a **safe, efficient, and standards-compliant electrical system** for a residential building. The scope of the design includes:

- Lighting layout and illumination calculations  
- Power socket and appliance load analysis  
- Switchboard, Sub-Distribution Board (SDB), Emergency SDB (ESDB), and Main Distribution Board (MDB) design  
- Cable sizing, protection devices (MCB, MCCB), and load calculations  
- Emergency power system with generator integration  
- Lightning protection system design  
- Complete **AutoCAD-based layouts** for fittings and conduits  

All designs follow standard electrical engineering practices and safety considerations.

## 🧩 Final Layout Description

The **Final Layout** folder contains the complete electrical design of the building, including:

### Floor Coverage

- **Ground Floor:** Parking, guard room, driver room, kitchen, store room, bathrooms, staircases, lift area  
- **1st to 5th Floors:** Bedrooms, drawing room, dining room, kitchen, bathrooms, corridors, verandas  

### Detailed Placement of

1. Lighting fixtures (LB, LS, TA, TB, etc.)  
2. Fans and socket outlets  
3. Switchboards  
4. Conduit routing  
5. Emergency lighting points  

Each layout is designed to ensure optimal illumination, operational safety, and ease of maintenance.
